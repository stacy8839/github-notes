# github-notes
This is a repo for the descriptions of:


**Git**:
Git is a tool that helps track changes in code or flies over time. It lets you save different versions of your work, go back to older versions of your work, and see what changes were made and when. 

**Repo**:
A GitHub Repo is like a folder stored online on GitHub. It holds your project files, such as code, text files, and a README. Repositories can be public or private, and they make it easy to share projects and work on them over time.

**Commit**:
A commit is a saved change in a project. When you make a commit, you are taking a snapshot of your work at that moment and adding a message that explains what you changed. Commits help track progress and show how a project evolves
